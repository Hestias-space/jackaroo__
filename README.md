Jackaroo is a 4 player game using 52 cards and 16 marbles. The goal of the game is to allow each of your 4 player marbles into their respective safe zone, while avoiding traps. This version adds a unique twist where some of the cards are wild cards, and they add special functionalities. (such as sending your opponent back to their home base)
*This game can be played entirely on console :)
